	<h1>Hello, i'm Pauline</h1>

			<p> 
				I was born in La Tronche which is a city next to Grenoble, in France. I used to live nearby until my 8th birthay, when my dad got a new job in Paris. Then, a few years later we moved to Toulouse as my dad changed jobs within the same company. Toulouse is still to this day my favourite city. After 5 years, we moved to Strasbourg, and then Nantes 2 years ago, but I never lived there as I am now finishing in my 4th year at ESSEC Business School, in Cergy.

	<h2>My Plans for the future</h2>
		<p>
			Right after I finish my 4th year, I want to work for a bit to learn more and have a better idea of what I want to do in the future. I am honestly quite lost but I wish to travel so why not trying to find a V.I.E. to live abroad for a year or two before starting a masters degree (hopefully at ESSEC or ESCP).

	<h2>Things I enjoy doing</h2>
		<p>
			As I grew up in the apls, I really enjoy hiking, especially alone, I find it quite peaceful, and skiing. I also love spending time with my friends and family, going out, partying. I also love cooking with my little brother.

	<h2>TV shows and movies</h2>
		<p>
			I enjoy, when I have the time to do so, watching TV shows and movies. My favourite movie is the King's Speech, the story and the cinematics are amazing. I also love Mamma Mia and Interstellar. My favourite TV Show is Grey's Anatomy but I also love the Crown and Downtown Abbey.
